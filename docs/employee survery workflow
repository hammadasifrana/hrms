Workflow Features
1. Survey Creation
HR or managers create a survey by adding a title, description, and duration in the surveys table.
Questions are added to the survey_questions table with their types (e.g., text, multiple choice, rating).
2. Survey Distribution
Employees are notified to participate in the survey (not part of the schema but can be implemented in the application layer).
3. Employee Participation
Employees submit responses in the survey_responses table.
If the survey is anonymous, employee_id in survey_responses is left NULL.
4. Results and Analysis
Responses are aggregated for analysis:
Text responses (response_text) for open-ended questions.
Frequency distribution for multiple-choice options (selected_option).
Average and distribution for ratings (rating_value).
