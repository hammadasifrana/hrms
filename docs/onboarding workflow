Workflow Features
1. Onboarding Process Initiation
HR or admin creates an onboarding workflow in the onboarding_workflows table when a new hire is confirmed.
Key fields: start date, assigned HR, initial status (initiated).
2. Task Assignment
Tasks like workstation setup, software account creation, and team introduction are added to the onboarding_tasks table.
Each task is assigned a deadline and responsibility.
3. Document Collection and Verification
HR lists required documents (e.g., ID proof, tax forms) in the onboarding_documents table.
Employees submit documents, and HR verifies them.
4. Training and Orientation
Training sessions are scheduled and tracked in the onboarding_trainings table.
Status is updated upon completion, and feedback is collected.
5. Monitoring and Completion
Once all tasks, documents, and training are complete, the workflow status in onboarding_workflows is updated to completed.
